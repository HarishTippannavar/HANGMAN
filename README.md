Hangman Game

Overview

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project is a simple implementation of the Hangman game using Python.

Features

Single-player mode.

Random word selection from a predefined list.

Interactive text-based gameplay.

Tracks remaining attempts and shows progress after each guess.

Displays the final outcome (win or lose) at the end of the game.

Requirements

Python 3.x

How to Play

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the hangman.py file.

Run the game using the command:

python hangman.py

The game will randomly select a word, and you will see the number of letters represented by underscores (_).

Guess one letter at a time by typing it into the terminal.

You will have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. Each incorrect guess reduces the remaining attempts.

If you guess the word before running out of attempts, you win. Otherwise, you lose, and the correct word will be revealed.

Example Gameplay

Welcome to Hangman!
The word is: _ _ _ _ _

Guess a letter: a
Correct guess!
The word is now: a _ a _ _

Guess a letter: b
Wrong guess! You have 5 attempts remaining.

...

Congratulations! You guessed the word: apple

File Structure

hangman.py: Main script containing the game logic.

words.txt (optional): A text file containing a list of words for the game. If this file is not present, the script will use a default word list.

Customization

To add more words, edit the words.txt file or modify the predefined list in the script.

You can change the number of attempts by adjusting the max_attempts variable in the script.

Future Enhancements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI).

Implement multiplayer mode.

Add difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard).

Allow users to add their own words during gameplay.
